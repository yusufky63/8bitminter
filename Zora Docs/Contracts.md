# Coins Contracts Introduction

Coins contracts consist of one immutable ERC20 contract that becomes your Coin, and another smart contract that acts as a factory to create new Coin contracts.

## Overview

The Zora Coins protocol provides a comprehensive suite of smart contracts that enable creators to launch their own social tokens with built-in liquidity and reward mechanisms. These contracts are designed to be simple to use while providing powerful functionality for token economies.

## Key Components

The Coins ecosystem consists of several integrated contracts that work together:

1. **[Coin Contract](/coins/contracts/coin)** - The core ERC20 token implementation that powers each creator's social token. This contract handles token transfers, approvals, and other standard ERC20 functionality with additional features specific to Zora Coins.

2. **[Factory Contract](/coins/contracts/factory)** - The entry point for creating new Coins. This contract deploys new Coin contracts, sets up Uniswap V3 pools, and manages the initial liquidity provision. All new Coins are created through this factory.

3. **[Metadata](/coins/contracts/metadata)** - The metadata specification for Zora Coins, detailing how token information is structured and accessed.

4. **[Rewards System](/coins/contracts/rewards)** - The mechanism that enables creators to earn rewards through various on-chain activities, including NFT minting and trading.

## Getting Started

To interact with these contracts programmatically, you can use the [Coins SDK](/coins/sdk) which provides a simple interface for creating and managing Coins.
