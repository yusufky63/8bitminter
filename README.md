# üöÄ VisionZ Coin Maker
Retro-Token Creator for Farcaster and Base, Powered by Smart Content Engines

VisionZ Coin Maker is a retro-themed Farcaster Mini App that allows users to create their own digital tokens with personalized images and descriptions. Users can create visually powerful and blockchain-compatible tokens in a nostalgic interface without the need for technical knowledge.

## üí° What it does

VisionZ allows users who love retro aesthetics to create their own personalized digital assets with just a few clicks. Images and content are guided by smart content engines working in the background; the user only needs to make selections and create.

## üß† The problem it solves

Creating tokens was a process that required technical knowledge. VisionZ transforms this complex structure into an intuitive interface, offering an experience where everyone can create their own digital assets ‚Äî easy, fun, and stylish.

## üöß Challenges I ran into

- Synchronized production of style-compatible, nostalgic, and consistent visuals with content engines
- Keeping the user experience simple while maintaining the retro concept within the Farcaster Mini App
- Error-free token deployment with Zora SDK
- Real-time onchain data integration and analysis
- Creating an accurate token scoring algorithm
- Implementing fallback systems for multiple AI services

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I used

- Next.js + TypeScript ‚Äì Powerful frontend infrastructure
- Tailwind CSS ‚Äì Customized design system for retro concept
- Wagmi + Zora SDK ‚Äì Blockchain and wallet integration
- Farcaster SDK ‚Äì Mini App compatibility
- Viem ‚Äì Ethereum interaction and onchain data fetching
- Multiple AI Services:
  - **Together API**: Text generation and image creation
  - **Stability AI**: High-quality image generation with advanced models
  - **Replicate**: Fallback image generation service
  - **Custom AI Analysis**: Token analysis and risk assessment

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it

We created a user-friendly design system: neon lines, CRT effects, retro typography. Then, through content engines, we produced stylized images and descriptions appropriate to the inputs received from the user. We then transferred this production directly to the blockchain with Zora SDK. The entire process was prepared in accordance with the Farcaster Mini App structure.

## üìö What we learned

- When simplicity and style are presented together, users feel more creative
- Visually supported token production offers not just an asset, but also a form of expression
- Thanks to Mini App structures, products can reach much wider audiences
- Real-time blockchain data integration significantly improves user decision-making
- Multi-API fallback systems ensure service reliability

## üîÆ What's next

- Add more features and improvements
- Optimize performance and fix bugs
- Redesign and enhance the UI
- Implement advanced trading features
- Add portfolio tracking capabilities
- Expand AI analysis capabilities

## üéØ Enhanced Token Details & Analysis System

### **Token Score & Rating System**
Our comprehensive scoring algorithm evaluates tokens across 5 key metrics:

```javascript
// Token Score Calculation (0-100 scale)
const tokenScore = {
  overall: overallScore,        // Weighted average of all metrics
  liquidity: liquidityScore,    // Based on market cap size
  volume: volumeScore,         // 24h and total volume performance
  community: communityScore,   // Holders + comments + transfer activity
  risk: riskScore,            // Age, holder distribution, liquidity risks
  growth: growthScore         // 24h market cap change performance
};

// Scoring Criteria:
- Liquidity: Market cap >$100K = 90pts, >$50K = 80pts, >$10K = 60pts
- Volume: 24h >$10K = 95pts, >$1K = 80pts, >$100 = 60pts
- Community: Holders + Comments + Transfer activity combined
- Risk: Inverted risk factors (age, concentration, liquidity)
- Growth: 24h change >50% = 95pts, >20% = 80pts, >10% = 70pts
```
