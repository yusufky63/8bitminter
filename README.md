 🚀 VisionZ Coin Maker
 Retro-Token Creator for Farcaster and Base, Powered by Smart Content Engines

VisionZ Coin Maker is a retro-themed Farcaster Mini App that allows users to create their own digital tokens with personalized images and descriptions. Users can create visually powerful and blockchain-compatible tokens in a nostalgic interface without the need for technical knowledge.

 💡 What it does

VisionZ allows users who love retro aesthetics to create their own personalized digital assets with just a few clicks. Images and content are guided by smart content engines working in the background; the user only needs to make selections and create.

 🧠 The problem it solves

Creating tokens was a process that required technical knowledge. VisionZ transforms this complex structure into an intuitive interface, offering an experience where everyone can create their own digital assets — easy, fun, and stylish.

 🚧 Challenges I ran into

- Synchronized production of style-compatible, nostalgic, and consistent visuals with content engines
- Keeping the user experience simple while maintaining the retro concept within the Farcaster Mini App
- Error-free token deployment with Zora SDK

 🛠️ Technologies I used

- Next.js + TypeScript – Powerful frontend infrastructure
- Tailwind CSS – Customized design system for retro concept
- Wagmi + Zora SDK – Blockchain and wallet integration
- Farcaster SDK – Mini App compatibility
- Together API
  - For visual production: Retro-style pixel art with Black Forest service
  - For content production: Text generation support for token names and descriptions

 🛠️ How we built it

We created a user-friendly design system: neon lines, CRT effects, retro typography. Then, through content engines, we produced stylized images and descriptions appropriate to the inputs received from the user. We then transferred this production directly to the blockchain with Zora SDK. The entire process was prepared in accordance with the Farcaster Mini App structure.

 📚 What we learned

- When simplicity and style are presented together, users feel more creative
- Visually supported token production offers not just an asset, but also a form of expression
- Thanks to Mini App structures, products can reach much wider audiences

 🔮 What's next

- Add more features and improvements
- Optimize performance and fix bugs
- Redesign and enhance the UI
